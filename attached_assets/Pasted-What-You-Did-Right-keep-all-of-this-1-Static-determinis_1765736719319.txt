What You Did Right (keep all of this)
1. Static, deterministic sitemap

✔️ Perfect for a service business
✔️ No DB dependency, no runtime surprises
✔️ Google loves boring XML that never breaks

2. Service pages are explicitly enumerated
/services/hull-cleaning
/services/underwater-inspections
/services/zinc-changes


✔️ Excellent
✔️ Avoids orphan pages
✔️ Ensures all money pages are crawlable
✔️ Matches your actual service architecture

This is exactly how a small service business should do it.

3. Reasonable priorities and changefreq

Your values are sane:

Page	Priority	Verdict
/	1.0	Correct
/services/*	0.9	Correct
/about	0.8	Correct
/videos	0.8	Good (if active)
legal	0.3	Correct

Google largely ignores these, but they do no harm, and they help other crawlers.

What I’d Improve (SEO-focused, minimal changes)
1. Add service category root (important)

If you have /services as an index page, it must be included.

{ url: "/services", priority: "0.95", changefreq: "monthly" }


This page often:

Ranks for “commercial diving services Victoria”

Acts as a hub for internal linking equity

This is a small but real SEO win.

2. Add location page(s) if they exist

If you serve Victoria / Vancouver Island and have or plan pages like:

/victoria-commercial-diving

/vancouver-island-diver

They should be explicitly listed, not programmatic.

Local SEO ≠ dynamic routes. Be intentional.

3. Use res.type("application/xml")

Small polish, but cleaner Express usage:

res.type("application/xml");
res.send(sitemap);

4. Consider HTTP caching headers

This is free performance + crawl efficiency:

res.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=86400");


Google does not need a fresh sitemap every request.

5. Don’t over-rotate on lastmod

You’re using:

const currentDate = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];


This is fine, but it technically tells Google everything changes every day.

Better (optional):

Hardcode a deploy date

Or only update when services actually change

Not critical, but more “honest”.

Minor SEO Notes (Reality Check)

Google does not rank you higher because of:

priority

changefreq

Google does use sitemap to:

discover pages faster

confirm canonical URLs

crawl new service pages quickly

Your sitemap does exactly what it should.

Final Verdict

For a local, SEO-driven service business like Danny’s Diving:

✔️ Correct architecture
✔️ No over-engineering
✔️ No “AI SEO slop”
✔️ Very hard to screw up

Grade: A-

Add /services + any geo pages and you’re at A / A+.

If you want, next we can:

Tune service slugs for actual search demand

Decide if /videos helps or hurts SEO

Design a sitemap index (only if you scale content)
